  <li>1 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
  <li>1 cup idli rice (or parboiled rice)</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
  <li>2 cups water</li>

    Wash and soak urad dal, rice, and fenugreek seeds in 2 cups of water for 6
    hours. Drain and grind into a smooth batter with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add
    water if necessary to get the desired consistency.

  <li>
    Heat a nonstick griddle or skillet over medium heat, and grease lightly with
    oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle, and spread into a thin
    circle. Cook until the edges begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook
    until the other side is browned, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and
