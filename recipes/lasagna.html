      <!-- Description of the Food -->
      <p>
        Lasagna is a dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating
        with layers of sauce, cheese, and other ingredients. It is a traditional
        dish of Italian cuisine. The word lasagna is the plural of the Italian
        lasagna, a diminutive of the word lasso, meaning "little lasagne". The
        dish is popular in many countries, and is commonly made with a
        meat-based sauce, but can also be made with vegetables or cheese. It is
        often served with garlic bread and a green salad.

      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large skillet, cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic
          over medium heat until evenly brown. Drain off fat, and stir in the
          tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, sugar, oregano, basil, fennel
          seeds, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Simmer for at least 1
          hour, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13
          inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
          noodles for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan
          cheese, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Spread 1/3 of the meat sauce in
          the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 3 uncooked lasagna
          noodles, overlapping as needed. Spread with half of the ricotta cheese
          mixture. Repeat layers, and top with remaining meat sauce. Cover with
          aluminum foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
          spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and sprinkle with
          remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. Continue baking for
          25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and hot.
